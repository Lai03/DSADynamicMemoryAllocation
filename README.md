### Static Memory Allocation
  - When variables are declared in a program (based on regular syntaxes), a set of memory chunks are allocated for them at the compile time, before the program runs.
  - Can't specify array size when the program runs

  - NOT ALLOWED

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

### Dynamic Memory Deletion 
- Dynamically allocated memory can be deleted when the program runs, to free space for new allocations.

- Can't delete statically allowcated memory
-  EX:   ![image](https://github.com/Lai03/DSADynamicMemoryAllocation/assets/123115328/6acd58ce-ed85-4980-853b-c9add2afc2ec)
- The pointer assigned to the dynamically allowcated memory is the only way to know where that memory is
- SO delete first then reassign

## Vector
- A vector is an array-like abstract data type that supports operations like size, empty, set, erase, etc.
